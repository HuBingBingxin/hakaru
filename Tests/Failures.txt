As of Fri Feb. 13th, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t55 - differences in how piecewise are laid out (in non-trivial ways)
t56 - same as t55
t57 - same as t55
t49 - still a pretty-printing issue?
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
mhPriorProp - [Huge!] Error, Don't know how to deal with condition 1/4.
testGibbsPropUnif - [Huger!]  Issue with product of piecewise not being handled properly
testKernel - failure in recognition of density (and categorical)

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testLinreg - ignored
borelishDiv - Or(x <=0, 1<=x, 1/rr2*x <= 0, 1<= 1/rr2*x) is an invalid property
culpepper - expected superpose of 2 things, got just 1.  testD bug?
density2 - time expired
disintegrate1 - (x+ln(`freeze/R32`)) should be a ratpoly in ([`freeze/R32`])
disintegrate3 - weird stuff: rr2+infinity, nested piecewise
disintegrate5 - [Enormous] time expired
disintegrate7 - (collect/series) invalid input: too many and/or wrong types of arguments passed to series/infinity; first unused argument is infinity
disintegrate9 - _Inert_EQUATION is not implemented yet

Relationships:
t1 - Prob vs Real
t2 - error in ordering of arguments to GammaD
t3 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t4 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented

==============
Used to fail but are now fixed:
t21 - 'contradictory assumptions' from assuming not caught
density3 - Or( x<= 0, 1<=x, rr2 <> 10*x-5) is an invalid property
disintegrate4 - (in simp_poly) cannot determine if this expression is true or false: FAIL < 1
t54 - Or(...) is an invalid property
t52 - order difference in list parameters
gamalonDis - Or(..) is an invalid property
density1 - Or(..) is an invalid property
disintegrate2 - Or(..) is an invalid property
disintegrate6 - Or(..) is an invalid property
