As of Wed. April. 8th, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t56 - minor difference in display of conditions
t57 - minor difference in display of conditions
t60 - x1 + x2 <> x2 + x1 !!!  [testing by comparing pretty-printing is
  fragile, and was bound to show up in this way]
t62 - (x0 / x1) vs (x0 * recip x1) vs x1 ** (-1)
t63 - integration succeeds, but outputs all sorts of functions that
  cannot currently be handlded, resulting in a hard error.
t64 - some internal change has made a '42' come out as a weight.
   this feels like a new bug
t65 - completely different result now -- looks like an integral no
  longer computes.
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
t52 - ordering, same kind of issue as t60
testKernel - failure in recognition of density (and categorical)

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testLinreg - ignored
gamalonDis - time expired (15s)

Relationships:
t1 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t3 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t4 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t5 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t8 - join on Mixed, Real [bug]
t9 - Measure(Int) issue [because Int is not yet handled]
t11 - type inference issue (hard to debug because of x-x)
t12 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t13 - type inference case missing
t14 - type inference bug?
t16 - hmm, nested integral of normal which should have worked!
t17 - ordering
t18 - ordering
t19 - bug (new symptom)
t20 - bug (likely same as t19)
t21 - sums not handled yet
t22 - something was not normalized properly
t23 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented

Vector:
(nothing is really expected to work here)

Embed:
P2-id: parse error?
