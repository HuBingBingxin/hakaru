As of Tues. May. 5th, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t56 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t57 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t58 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t60 - ordering difference
t62 - round-trips, but normalizes differently
t63 - round-trips, but normalizes differently
t64 - t64 and t64' don't simplify to the same t64'', just close!
t65 - completely different result now -- looks like an integral no
  longer computes. (uniform 0 1)
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Was: Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
t78 - expects a change of variables?
t52 - ordering issue
mhPriorProp - difference in result (not analyzed yet)
t75 - time expired
t75' - time expired
testRoadMapProg1 - time expired
testRoadMapProg4 - Don't know how to make 1/... real
testKernel - failure to recognize a normal under a conditional
testFalseDetection: time expired
testTrueDetectionL: 1 <= FAIL
  -- problem is that the simplifier has a deep design flaw: too deep
     an assumptions that things will be ``polynomial'' once other
     things are frozen.  This is just false.  Will need a redesign.
testTrueDetectionR: infinite loop 

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testdistLinregSimp - ordering problem
testLinreg - ignored
gamalonDis - type inference issue on unpair

Relationships:
t1 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t3 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t4 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t5 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t8 - normalization difference
t9 - Prob from 1-pp1  ?
t11 - don't know how to make h3 real!
t12 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t13 - h2 ** (recip pp1) does not typecheck in Haskell
t14 - sqrt of Prob (mkProb bug)
t16 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t17 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t18 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t19 - reasoning about Reduce
t20 - reasoning about Reduce
t21 - Prob ** Int does not typecheck
t22 - something was not normalized properly
t23 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t24 - pp3 ** pp2 does not typecheck (mkProb bug)
t25 - (pp3+pp4) ** (-1) expects lhs to be Real
t26 - don't know how to make (1/...) real
t27 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t28 - make Prob from 1-x3
t29 - reasoning about Reduce

Vector: (not all fail anymore!)
testUnrolling - reasoning about Reduce
testUnity - categorical not implemented
testInside - Vector return type not implemented
testPull - reasoning about Reduce
t75 - reasoning about Reduce
testConj - reasoning about Reduce
testPlateDirac - Vector type inference missing

Embed:
