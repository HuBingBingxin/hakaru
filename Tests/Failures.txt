As of Sun Feb.8th, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t55 - differences in how piecewise are laid out
t56 - same kind as t55, but I would argue what is returned now is better than what is 'wanted'
t57 - same as t56
t49 - still a pretty-printing issue?
t21 - 'contradictory assumptions' from assuming not caught
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
t52 - order difference in list parameters
mhPriorProp - [Huge!] Error, Don't know how to deal with condition 1/4.
testGibbsPropUnif - [Huger!]  Issue with product of piecewise not being handled properly
testKernel - failure in recognition of density (and categorical)

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testLinreg - ignored
borelishDiv - Or(x <=0, 1<=x, 1/rr2*x <= 0, 1<= 1/rr2*x) is an invalid property
culpepper - expected superpose of 2 things, got just 1.  testD bug?
density1 - Error, (in simp_poly) Expected pw or binder, got (undefined)
density2 - 'contradictory assumptions' from assuming not caught
density3 - Or( x<= 0, 1<=x, rr2 <> 10*x-5) is an invalid propert
disintegrate1 - Expected a pw or a binder, got (undefined)
disintegrate3 - weird stuff: rr2+infinity, nested piecewise
disintegrate4 - (in simp_poly) cannot determine if this expression is true or false: FAIL < 1
disintegrate5 - [Enormous] time expired
disintegrate7 - (collect/series) invalid input: too many and/or wrong types of arguments passed to series/infinity; first unused argument is infinity
disintegrate9 - _Inert_EQUATIOM is not implemented yet

Relationships:
t1 - Prob vs Real
t2 - error in ordering of arguments to GammaD
t3 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t4 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
