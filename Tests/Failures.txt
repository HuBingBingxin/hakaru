As of Sat. May. 2nd, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t54 - invalid property 
t56 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t57 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t58 - probable bug in convert/Heaviside
t60 - ordering difference
t62 - problem with assumption on x0/x1
t63 - problem with assumption on non-name
t64 - problem in merging of product of piecewise
t65 - completely different result now -- looks like an integral no
  longer computes. (uniform 0 1)
t21 - invalid arguments to coeffs
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
t70b - contradictory assumptions in assume
t71b - `uniform 3 3 `bind` \x0 -> superpose [] instead of superpose []
t73c - same as above
t74c - contradictory assumptions
t76 - wrong number of arguments
t78 - expects a change of variables?
t52 - ordering problem
mhPriorProp - difference in result (not analyzed yet)
t75 - time expired
t75' - time expired
testRoadMapProg1 - time expired
testRoadMapProg4 - make Prob from piecewise?
testKernel - failure in recognition of density (and categorical)
testFalseDetection: Real/Prob inference issue
testTrueDetectionL: arctan when polynomial expected

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testdistLinregSimp - time expired
