As of Wed. April. 8th, the failures are as follows:

RoundTrip:
t56 - difference in display of conditions
t57 - difference in display of conditions
t60 - x1 + x2 <> x2 + x1 !!!  [testing by comparing pretty-printing is
  fragile, and was bound to show up in this way]
t62 - (x0 / x1) vs (x0 * recip x1) vs x1 ** (-1)
t63 - integration succeeds, but outputs all sorts of functions that
  cannot currently be handlded, resulting in a hard error.
t64 - some internal change has made a '42' come out as a weight.
   this feels like a new bug
t65 - completely different result now -- looks like an integral no
  longer computes. (uniform 0 1)
t45 - pw/domain interaction with density recognition
t50 - Maple returns Ei in result, which does not exist in Hakaru
lebesgue2 -- wrong order!!!
t52 - "cannot determine if this expression is true or false: h1 < 1
mhPriorProp - change of placement of - signs
testGibbsPropUnif -- new issue with undefined
testKernel - failure in recognition of density (and categorical)

Syntax:
pair1fst/snd - beta instead of list/categorical
testdistLinregSimp - time expired
testLinreg - ignored
gamalonDis - time expired (15s)

Relationships:
t1 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t3 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t4 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t5 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t8 - type inference bug
t9 - Prob from 1-pp1  ?
t11 - don't know how to make (h3-h4) real
t12 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t13 - type inference case missing
t14 - type inference bug?
t16 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t17 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented
t18 - don't know how to make (...) real
t19 - symbolic Vector
t20 - symbolic Vector
t21 - infer from (pp1+pp2)^h3
t22 - something was not normalized properly
t23 - no simplification because change of variables not implemented

Vector:
testReduce - join2type of Nat, Int (why Int ??)
testUnrolling - can't evaluate enough to see measure [EM]
testUnity - EM
testInside - Vector return type not implemented
testPull - EM
testConj - Vector 'type' not properly dealt with
testPlateDirac - EM (different symptom)

Embed:
P2-id: parse error?
