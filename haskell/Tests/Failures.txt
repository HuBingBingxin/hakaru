[Completely new set of tests/failures starting some time in mid-2016.
This report is as of June 14th]

t25: printing of n-ary * artifact [Rob]
t55: difference is between "weight 0" and "reject".  NewSLO as
  currently designed treats MSum() as equivalent to the 0 measure.
  Thus the difference between expected and actual. [Design?]
t57:  issue is that
   Indicator(t<1) * m + Indicator(0<t) * m
    for any measure m, does not simplify, by combining these indicators.

t78: what is expected is that a (trivial!!!) change of variable be done
  to rescale from 0..2 to 0..1.  This means that 
    x <~ uniform 0 2
    weight(x, return x)
    [up to casts] returns as is instead of 'recognizing' a beta(2,1)
    [Design]
