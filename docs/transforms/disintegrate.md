# Disintegrations transformation

The disintegration transformation takes as input a program
representing a joint probability distribution, and returns
a program which represents an posterior distribution.

## Disintegrate

Disintegrate can be accessed using the `disintegrate` command.

## Density

Find the density of a probability distribution at a particular
point is actually a special-case of disintegrate and is
defined in terms of it.
