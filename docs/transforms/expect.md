# Expectation transformation

The expectation transformation takes a program representing a measure,
and a function over the sample space, and returns a program computing
the expectation over that measure with respect to the given function.

## Normalize

We also provide a `normalize` command. This command takes as input a
program representing any measure and reweights it into a program
representing a probability distribution.
