-- The interface for abstract binding trees. Given the generating

-- adding variables and binding; and each 'ABT' type (1) provides
-- some additional annotations at each recursion site, and then (2)
-- ties the knot to produce the recursive trees. For an introduction

-- of 'View' so that we can unpack the implementation of 'Variable'
-- into the 'Var' constructor. That is, the current version does
-- this unpacking, but if we parameterize the variable implementation

-- | A combinator for defining a HOAS-like API for our syntax.
-- Because our 'AST' is first-order, we cannot actually have any
-- exotic terms in our language. In principle, this function could
-- be used to do exotic things when constructing those non-exotic
-- terms; however, trying to do anything other than change the
-- variable's name hint will cause things to explode (since it'll
-- interfere with our tying-the-knot).
--
-- N.B., if you manually construct free variables and use them in
-- the body (i.e., via 'var'), they may become captured by the new
-- binding introduced here! This is inevitable since 'nextBind'
-- never looks at variable /use sites/; it only ever looks at
-- /binding sites/. On the other hand, if you manually construct a
-- bound variable (i.e., manually calling 'bind' yourself), then
-- the new binding introduced here will respect the old binding and
-- avoid that variable ID.
